    <h1>Concordion-NET</h1>
    <p>Concordion-NET is an open source framework for writing automated
      acceptance tests in C# and was initially ported from the <a href="http://concordion.org/">Java
        version of Concordion</a>. It supports <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/">Behavior
        Driven Development</a> (BDD) similar to great tools such as <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>,
      <a href="http://www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a>, <a href="http://fitnesse.org/">FitNesse</a>,
      and <a href="http://nbehave.org/">NBehave</a>. According to the excellent
      <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2010/03/classifying-bdd-tools-unit-test-driven.html">classification
        of BDD tools</a>, it focuses on business readable input (and reaches
      business readable output as well). Concordion acceptance tests are so
      readable, they can double up as system documentation. They are written in
      HTML, so can be easily hyperlinked into a navigable structure. And, since
      the tests run against the system, you can be confident the documentation
      is always up-to-date.</p>
    <p>Here you find some additional information to start working with
      Concordion-NET:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On the <a href="GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> page you'll
        find a kick-start solution for your C# projects in Visual Studio as well
        as a first example.</li>
      <li>To setup your infrastructure, please <a href="https://github.com/x97mdr/concordion-net/downloads">Download</a>

    <h2>Specification by Example</h2>
    <p>As Concordion specifications are written in simple HTML, it provides a
      good basis for a <a href="http://specificationbyexample.com/key_ideas.html">living
        documentation system</a>. You can use a what-you-see-is-what-you-get
      (WYSIWYG) editor like <a href="http://bluegriffon.org/pages/Download">BlueGriffon
        </a>to describe your intended behavior of your software in simple HTML
      documents and instrument them to verify your system under test.</p>
    <p>Watch the <a href="http://gojko.net/2009/09/01/acceptance-testing-in-plain-english-with-concordion-net/">video
        to see how to use Concordion-NET</a>. As the <span style="font-style: italic;">active
        specifications</span> are readable to business people, it can help to
      achieve the goal of <a href="http://jacekratzinger.blogspot.co.at/2012/01/purpose-driven-development-pdd.html">purpose
        driven development</a>. Concrete examples within your specifications are
      turned into executable specifications with a <a href="http://concordion.org/dist/1.4.4/spec/concordion/Concordion.html">small
        set of commands</a> (e.g. "set", "execute", "assertEquals"). These allow
      checking the examples against the real-life system.</p>

    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> The <a href="http://concordion.org/Tutorial.html">original
          Concordion tutorial</a> provides an introduction with examples and
        describes the Concordion commands that can be used for instrumentation.
        Please note that it is based on the Java version of Concordion, but the
        test classes and test methods can be easily translated to C#. You find a
        short introduction on the .NET version on the <a href="file:///C:/Data/github/concordion-net/Doc/GettingStarted.html">Getting
          Started</a> page.</li>
      <li>Jeffrey Cameron has written a blog on <a href="http://living-in-concordion.blogspot.co.at/2009/05/your-first-concordionnet-project-part-1.html">living
          in Concordion with .NET</a>. Please note that you can <a href="RunningTests.html">use
          NUnit to run Concordion-NET tests</a> (instead of Gallio). Thus, you
        can skip <a href="http://living-in-concordion.blogspot.co.at/2009/05/your-first-concordionnet-project-part-5.html">part
          5</a> of the blog that relates to Gallio. If you want to debug
        Concordion-NET tests, please read the blog on <a href="http://erraticdev.blogspot.co.at/2012/01/running-or-debugging-nunit-tests-from.html">debugging

      <li>Concordion-NET has been moved from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/concordion-net/">Google
