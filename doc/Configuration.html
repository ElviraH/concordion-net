        <h1>How to configure Concordion-NET</h1>
        <p>In contrast to the Java version of Concordion, where configuration is
          done via system properties, Concordion-NET uses two types of
          configuration files to define basic parameters for running
          Concordion-NET fixtures.</p>
        <ol>
        </ol>
        <h2>1. Concordion.config</h2>
        <ol>
        </ol>
        This first configuration file contains setting for the test runners to
        be used. The default test runner of concordion is the RunTestRunner. An
        example configuration setting up this runner is shown below. However, it
        is not necessary to define any runners at all - if Concordion-NET does
        not find a particular configuration for any runnner, it uses this
        default one. If you want to use any other test runner, you can configure
        that in the Concordion.config file. The file has to be located in the
        same directory as the concordion.dll to be found by the Concordion-NET
        framework.<br>
        <h3>Runners</h3>
        <p>Runners are used to call and run one specification from another
          specification. Another specification may be in a different testing
          suite (like FIT, FitNesse, Cucumber, etc.) </p>
        <h4>Runner</h4>
        <p>Each runner element has two attributes that must be present to be
          recognised properly. They are "alias" and "type". The alias is used to
          refer to the type in the concordion:run="alias" statement. The type is
          the Assembly-Qualified Name of the type that you will associate with
          the alias and will be used to run the called specification. See the
          specification for Run for more details. </p>
        <br>
        <pre class="html">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Concordion&gt;
  &lt;Runners&gt;
    &lt;Runner
    	alias="runtestrunner"
    	type="Concordion.Spec.Concordion.Command.Run.RunTestRunner,
  		Concordion.Spec, Version=1.0.0.0,
  		Culture=neutral,
 	 	PublicKeyToken=null" /&gt;
  &lt;/Runners&gt;
&lt;/Concordion&gt;</pre>
        <ol>
          <li>&lt;your-spec-project&gt;.config</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The second file is specific for each project containing
          Concordion-NET documents and fixtures. This configuration file has the
          same file name as the dll file, but the file extension ".dll" is
          replaced by ".config". The file has to be located in the same
          directory as your &lt;spec&gt;.dll to be loaded by Concordion-NET.</p>
        <h3>BaseOutputDirectory</h3>
        <p>The BaseOutputDirectory element tells Concordion-NET where to place
          the results of running the active specifications. If this element is
          not specified then Concordion places the output in the directory
          defined by the users TEMP environment variable. </p>
        <pre class="html">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Specification&gt;
  &lt;BaseOutputDirectory path="C:\Dev\concordion-net\Results" /&gt;
&lt;/Specification&gt;</pre>
