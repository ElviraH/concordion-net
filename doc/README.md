# [Concordion.NET](http://www.concordion.org/dotnet/) Documentation

Welcome to the Concordion.NET documentation pages.

Concordion.NET is a handy, small framework that lets you turn a plain English description of requirements into automated tests. It supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) as well as Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). Concordion.NET acceptance tests are so readable, they can double up as system documentation. They are written in HTML, so can be easily hyperlinked into a navigable structure. And, since the tests run against the system, you can be confident the documentation is always up-to-date.

To get started, check out the [Overview](http://www.concordion.org/dotnet/index.html) page.

If you are new to Concordion.NET we recommend to start with the  [Getting Started](http://www.concordion.org/dotnet/GettingStarted.html) guide.
